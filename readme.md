# üç≠ Stream movies (v2 development) 

This is the development branch of version 2. Alot of things will change.

**Some of the key features which will be implemented in v2**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üëâ &nbsp;Support for TV shows    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üëâ &nbsp;MySQL database with IMDb data (so we dont have to rely on 3rd party API's)    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üëâ &nbsp;Redis caching layer    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üëâ &nbsp;Thepiratebay integration    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üëâ &nbsp;Subtitles integration (opensubtitles.org)    

## ‚ö°How does it work?

It works by searching for torrents via the https://yts.mx API based on a IMDb ID.

It will search for available torrents, parse the torrents and search for playable media, eg: .mp4 or .mkv files.

If it successfully fetched torrents, it will parse all the playable media files to find out if it can be played in the browser. If so, a flag on each `StreamObject` will be set.

All methods to do so are exposed via the API.

## ‚ö° Development

*This project was created in a WSL 2 Linux envoirment, you might run into problems when running it on windows. The problem might come from the `FFprobe` binaries.
